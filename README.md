# Maplestory Helper
For the calculation of the cost of upgrading equipment in Maplestory 
_Only Starforce and Epic potential calculation_ 

# General Description
Maplestory is an MMORPG with a sizeable player base. To progress through the game, good equipment is crucial. These equipment can be bought of the player market, or "created" by the players themselves.  

Due to the difficulty in the cost calculation, it can be a daunting task deciding whether to make one's own equipment or to purchase another player's.   

I created this tool to help myself and my friends make quick decision on purchases.  
As there are many factors in cost consideration, Monte Carlo method is used to average the cost instead of an expected value calculation, i.e. large number of simulations and averaged, before being presented as a result.
